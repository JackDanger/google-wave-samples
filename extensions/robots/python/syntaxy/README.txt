---- USING/RUNNING SYNTAXY ----
You will need two python libraries:

1) The Wave python client api
2) The Pygments syntax highlighting api
   - download it from pygments.org

Syntaxy expects these to be in two local folders waveapi and pygments.
You will also clearly need your own appengine app and change the app.yaml file appropriately.
